Excited to share Show Suggester—a project I've been building to solve a personal problem with film recommendations.

📌 The Problem:
Most recommendation algorithms optimize for engagement, not for YOUR taste. They push what makes them money, not what you'll actually love.

💡 The Solution:
Show Suggester uses content-based filtering to find films similar to ones you've already liked. No tracking. No ads. Works offline.

🎯 Key Features:
• 6,000+ films from diverse sources (awards, Bechdel Test, international cinema)
• Beautiful interface with movie posters
• 100% offline—your data stays on your device
• Smart recommendations that adapt to diverse tastes
• Export to ChatGPT/Claude for AI-powered suggestions

🚀 What Makes It Different:
✓ No backend server or API keys
✓ Works offline after initial load
✓ Privacy-first design (no tracking)
✓ Open source—AGPL licensed
✓ Vanilla JavaScript—no unnecessary dependencies

🤝 Looking for Collaborators:
• Python developers (expand dataset, improve algorithm)
• Frontend engineers (UI enhancements, mobile optimization)
• Film enthusiasts (curate datasets, suggest sources)
• Data analysts (improve recommendation quality)

Whether you're a seasoned developer or building portfolio projects, there's something to contribute.

Title: Why I Built a Film Recommendation Engine That Works Offline

Recently, I launched Show Suggester—an open-source tool for discovering films you'll actually love. Here's why it matters.

**The Problem with Modern Recommendations**

Every major streaming platform uses collaborative filtering (what millions of people watched) combined with engagement optimization (what keeps you watching longer). The result? Recommendations that are optimized to make you *addicted*, not *satisfied*.

**A Better Approach: Content-Based Filtering**

Show Suggester takes a different approach. It analyzes the *content* of films you've loved and finds similar ones:
- Genre overlap
- Director/cast matches
- Year/era proximity
- Runtime preferences

It's transparent (you can see why something's recommended), honest (no engagement manipulation), and effective.

**The Privacy Advantage**

All recommendations run locally in your browser. Your ratings never leave your device. No tracking. No profile building. No data selling.

**Looking for Collaborators**

Show Suggester is entirely open source (AGPL-3.0) and looking for contributors:
- Want to expand our film database? Python dev needed
- Want to improve the UI? Frontend dev needed
- Want to curate film lists? Film expert needed

All skill levels welcome. This is a learning-friendly community.
