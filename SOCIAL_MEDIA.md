### Post 3: Feature Highlight

Just added movie posters to Show Suggester! 🍿

Now when you're rating films, you see beautiful posters instead of just titles. Makes it SO much easier to remember what you actually watched.

No more "wait which movie was that again?" 😂

Excited to share Show Suggester—a project I've been building to solve a personal problem with film recommendations.

📌 The Problem:
Most recommendation algorithms optimize for engagement, not for YOUR taste. They push what makes them money, not what you'll actually love.

💡 The Solution:
Show Suggester uses content-based filtering to find films similar to ones you've already liked. No tracking. No ads. Works offline.

🎯 Key Features:
• 6,000+ films from diverse sources (awards, Bechdel Test, international cinema)
• Beautiful interface with movie posters
• 100% offline—your data stays on your device
• Smart recommendations that adapt to diverse tastes
• Export to ChatGPT/Claude for AI-powered suggestions

🚀 What Makes It Different:
✓ No backend server or API keys
✓ Works offline after initial load
✓ Privacy-first design (no tracking)
✓ Open source—MIT licensed
✓ Vanilla JavaScript—no unnecessary dependencies

🤝 Looking for Collaborators:
• Python developers (expand dataset, improve algorithm)
• Frontend engineers (UI enhancements, mobile optimization)
• Film enthusiasts (curate datasets, suggest sources)
• Data analysts (improve recommendation quality)

Whether you're a seasoned developer or building portfolio projects, there's something to contribute.

Title: Show Suggester—Smart Film Recommendations in Vanilla JS (No Frameworks!)

Just launched Show Suggester—a film recommendation app built entirely in vanilla JavaScript.

**Why this matters:**
Most people learning to code gravitate toward frameworks. Show Suggester proves you can build complex, beautiful UIs without them. Perfect for understanding core JS concepts.

**Key Learnings:**
- Content-based filtering algorithm
- Client-side data persistence (localStorage)
- Real-time filtering & sorting
- Responsive CSS Grid/Flexbox
- API integration (TMDb for posters)

**Code highlights:**
- 1,800 lines of clean, readable JS
- Modular design (easy to extend)
- No build step—works by opening index.html
- Full offline support

**Currently open for:**
- Frontend improvements (PR welcome!)
- Mobile optimization
- Performance enhancements
- General feedback

Title: Python Dataset Tool for Show Suggester (6,000+ Films, Open Source)

If you're interested in data processing, APIs, and working with large datasets—come check out our dataset expansion tool!

- Fetches films from Bechdel Test API (10K+ films)
- Integrates TMDb API for poster images
- Deduplicates across multiple sources
- Rate limiting to be API-friendly
- Creates two curated datasets (core + extended)

**Challenges we've solved:**
- Handling 10K+ API calls with proper rate limiting
- Deduplicating movies with inconsistent data
- Merging data from 15+ different sources
- Lazy-loading large JSON files efficiently

**Want to contribute?**
- Add new film sources (Criterion, film festivals)
- Improve data quality validation
- Create analysis tools
- Optimize for performance
